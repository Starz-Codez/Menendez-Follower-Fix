# Menendez-Follower-Fix
Menendez 3d Printed Magazine Follower that allows the last round to load without locking the slide

Print on side at a 45 deg angle
Slide lock notch away from the bed
Tree supports recommended 

The orientation the file opens up to should already be set to the above specified

This Fixes the issue on the original follower where the slide would lock pre-maturely on the last round

i have simply modified the original follower to fix this issue and it works no problem the slide locks open on empty butno pre-maturely
